 --- below it is the base query
 --  we can find all NR/RPI campaignsâ€™ update dates when we 1) switch targets 2) apply manual adjustment 3)apply any system-wide margin update 4)when we change margin exploration algorithm. and we can find all disabled campaigns
 --  all campaigns are enabled campaigns after 2023/01/01. Any campaigns that are paused after 01/01 will be excluded.
 --  how to use each columns as filter:
 --  num_target is a good way to help you find campaigns where targets have been changed. Please reach out to me if you find num_target = 0.
 --  updated_source is a filter to find manual update (=skipper), treasurer update (=treasurer), and eng-driven adhoc update (=adhoc).
